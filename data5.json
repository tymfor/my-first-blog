Probably the most high profile example of the application of this technique is the construction and maintenance of the Panama Canal (Duncan, 2008). Generally, however, it is only practical on small slumps or small rotational slides. Large scale excavation of larger landslide areas is usually not recommended for several reasons (Highland and Bobrowsky, 2008):\n\u00b7 Excavation is not always effective. For large planar failures, excavation may not cause movements to stop and may allow the landslide to expand.\n\u00b7 Excavation may actually destibilize the ground further upslope by undercutting, which weakens the slope, even to the point of triggering a larger slide than is being mitigated.\n\u00b7 In certain soil profiles, where there are several actual or potential failure surfaces at different depths, excavating down to the top failure surface might trigger sliding on deeper failure surfaces.\n\u00b7 Excavation may interfere with surface runoff and water courses; unless this is properly addressed, it may cause backdrops and areas of temporary or permanent stagnant water with resulting changes to infiltration and the groundwater regime of the slope, or favouring erosion in areas previously protected by the slide mass.\nComplete removal of the landslide body is only effective at mitigating the hazard of further movement if the slope can be reprofiled at a lower inclination compared to the original, failed, slope and/or additional hazard mitigation measures are implemented. If this is not carried out, removing the landslide debris is equivalent to accelerated erosion at the toe of the slope where this was a cause of the original landslide, recreating the conditions for further sliding to take place.\nExcavation may alter drainage patterns, with potentially detrimental effects on the stability of the area; care should be paid to diverting surface water flows away from the excavated areas and to ensure that reprofiling does not create conditions for stagnant water to accumulate in low lying areas. Similarly, it is necessary to ensure that the materials exposed by the removal of the landslide body are not susceptible to or are adequately protected from rapid weathering which could cause renewed landsliding. To facilitate construction and maintenance of drainage and surgface protection works, excavated surfaces are typically shaped to form a number of benches, typically at 6 to 10 m vertical interval.\nThe equipment and methods of excavation will need to be selected to suit the nature of the material to be excavated and local conditions in general. Even when the parent, undisturbed material is rock, landsliding may have broken up the mass sufficiently for it to be excavated by conventional equipment. However, it is not rare for the landslide debris to retain sufficient remnants of the original structure and consistency of the parent material that excavation and removal of the landslide debris requires specialist equipment, such as hydraulic hammers or even explosives. In these situations, careful consideration will be given to the need to minimize vibrations, if there is a risk of these triggering further movement. ", "design_text": "In all cases a careful review of ground, groundwater and drainage conditions needs to be undertaken before any excavation is carried out. When considering complete removal of the landslide body, it is necessary to evaluate the stability of the slope in the proposed final configuration, with particular attention to the stability of the slope above the excavated area. The principles and methods of analysis are decribed in the general fact-sheet 2.0 on \u201cHazard reduction by modifying the slope geometry or mass distribution\u201d.\nThe design should consider the method and sequence of excavation, to ensure stability at all times, especially when excavating active landslides; typically, excavation should proceed from the top of the slope downwards, rather than from the toe, to ensure that the work is carried out safely.\nThe design should also consider the final disposal of the excavated material, which can be a serious problem in some cases. Uncontrolled tipping of the material downslope of the excavated area, as often practiced in emergency rehabilitation of rural roads in mountainous terrain, should be avoided since it can damage the existing vegetation and it can create a serious hazard of further sliding downhill. \nSpecial care needs to be paid if the landslide mass is suspected to contain contaminated materials, for whatever reason, since this may require special provision with respect to ensuring the safety of both workers and the public and with respect to arrangements for the disposal of arisings.", "reference": "Duncan J.M.

Larger scale reprofiling of rock slopes falls within the scope of sheet 2.1 \u2013 \u201cRemoval of (actually or potentially) unstable soil/rock mass\u201d. In particular, \u201ctrimming\u201d refers mainly to the removal of potentially unstable overhangs, bulges and other geometric anomalies protruding above the general lay of the slope, while \u201cscaling\u201d refers to the removal of individual blocks or boulders which may be or readily become detached from the slope, even if they do not represent a geometric anomaly.\nTrimming and scaling may be carried out by a variety of methods and techniques, depending on the size of anomaly to be removed and, even more importantly, access conditions. While scaling can be carried out, to some extent, by conventional hand held tools, such as pry bars, shovels, etc., this may need to be supplemented by controlled blasting or other significant mechanical assistance, especially when trimming involves the removal of blocks which are not yet detached.\nWhere small scale blasting is used, blast mats may need to be used to prevent flying debris, since typically there will be insufficient overburden to provide confinement. To minimize the risk of blasting causing uncontrolled fracturing of the rock, requiring additional trimming and scaling, cotrolled blasting is typically carried out by drilling one or more series of closely spaced (typically at 10 to 12 times the diameter), parallel holes along the intended breakline to evenly distribute the explosive on the face. Holes drilled by hand-held equipment are normally up to 40mm diameter and up to 3 m in length. Typically, low-velocity explosive is used, with a decoupling ratio (the ratio between the the hole diameter and that of the explosive) of about 2 to limit the pressure on the side of the hole to limit uncontrolled fracturing, stemming the holes to minimize venting and detonating each hole on a single delay. Where the thickness of material to be removed is significant, multiple breaking lines are detonated in sequence, starting from that nearest the free face, to the final line.\nBlasting is often precluded by regulations in or near urban areas. Blanket bans on blasting may be in force in some countries or it may be so cumbersome to obtain permission for and to actually carry out blasting that to all effects this option is not available. In this case, alternative methods of demolition may be considered, depending on circumstances, including:\n\u00b7 hydraulic hammers (rock breakers), either hand held or mounted on the boom of an excavator;\n\u00b7 hydraulic rock splitters, which are inserted in a line of drilled holes and expanded hydraulically to create or open cracks;\n\u00b7 expansive grouts (soundless chemical demolition agents), which expand slowly as a result of chemical reactions. \nBoth trimming and scaling can be highly dangerous and need to be carried out by specialist personnel operating under a strict safety regime. Typically the work is carried out proceeding from the po of the slope downwards, so that the workers are not unnecessarily exposed to the hazard of material falling from above and to avoid that the debris from the operation accumulates on previously completed portions of the slope.\nWorkers and equipment are typically suspended from ropes anchored in a safe area above the slope. On smaller slopes, access can be provided by self elevating platforms, with heavier equipment suspended from cranes, but this arrangement tends to be cumbersome and does not afford workers the same freedom of movement in case of need. \nSince the debris from these operations will fall to the base of the slope, access to this area must be restricted during this type of work and the exclusion zone must extend sufficiently to cover for all possible run-out trajectories. Vulnerable structures within the exclusion zone may need to be temporarily protected. \nTrimming and scaling may need to be repeated at regular intervals, especially if the rock is susceptible to rapid weathering, for example in mountain areas subjected to repeated freeze-thaw cycles, or where the rock face is overlain by debris. ", "design_text": "The design of scaling and trimming does not typically involve calculation. Rather, the design involves the identification and mapping of the main unstable blocks, bulges and overhangs that need to be removed, delegating to some extent to the workers on the face the task to determine whether a specific block needs to be removed, preferably to pre-defined criteria.", "reference": "Descoeudres F., Zimmeman T.

It is generally ineffective on translational slides on long, uniform planar slopes, or on flow-type landslides. \nGenerally it is most practical on small slumps or small rotational failures, but several examples exist where this technique has been applied successfully on large landslides where conditions allowed large scale earthmoving to be carried out.\nIt should always be kept in mind that the resisting forces are also reduced, especially in the long term, as a result of the reduction in normal stress on the failure surface. It is therefore necessary to locate the excavation in such manner that the reduction in driving forces exceeds the reduction in resisting forces. The neutral line concept, described in fact sheet 2.0 on \u201cmitigation by modifying the slope geometry / mass distribution; general aspects\u201d can be used for a preliminary evaluation of the relative merits of the proposed excavation. \nThe main limitations of the technique relate to the following issues:\n\u00b7 Excavation may actually destabilize the ground farther up-slope by ubdercutting ;\n\u00b7 Excavation increases safety factor by only a limited amount, which tends to decrease with time in low permeability saturated soils; satisfactory solutions may involve significant modification of the landscape (see for example Chatwin et al.,1994);\n\u00b7 Excavation results in large volumes of material to be disposed of off-site in a controlled manner, with attendant difficulties;\n\u00b7 Excavation may interfere with existing structures and services; This is potentially significant when considering this type of mitigation for \u201cpotential\u201d landslides, while on actual landslides the residual value of existing structures and facilities can be very low;\n\u00b7 Excavation impacts on the upper part of the slope, with the greatest potential visual impact on the landscape\n\u00b7 Excavation of active landslides requires special care to ensure the safety of workers; in particular, it is necessary to assess the possibility of sudden accelerations and to have in place well drilled evacuation plans.\nAll excavation in the upper part of a landslide must be accompanied by drainage works to redirect surface water away from infiltrating the landslide body. Typically, surface protection to newly excavated surfaces is also necessary to limit erosion and/or weathering. To facilitate construction and maintenance of drainage and surgface protection works, excavated surfaces are typically shaped to form a number of benches, typically at 6 to 10 m vertical interval.\nExamples of large landslides stabilized by this technique are shown in Figures 1 and 2. \nFigures 3 and 4 show the remedial works carried out at the Settebagni motorway cutting, just North of Rome, where major deep seated sliding occurred approximately 20 - 25 years after construction due to a thick plio-pleistocene clay layer daylighting in the cutting below a thick cover of otherwise stable tuffs and pyroclastic cinders (Pictures 1 and 2). The extent of the clay outcrop in the cutting is shown indicatively by the hard facing installed at the time of construction to safeguard fron erosion and shallow instability.

Clearly, manufactured materials are typically more expensive and synthetic material may have limited durability, but they afford greater reliability in terms of homogeneity of results; the use of waste materials or byproducts may also be subject to environmental constraints and concerns about possible long term pollution. \nThis technique operates on the principle of reducing the driving forces more than the resisting forces by altering the mass or load distribution on the slope, in the same manner and subject to similar considerations and limitations as described in fact-sheet 2.3 on \u201cRemoval of material from the driving area\u201d. It is most suitable in cases where the instability mechanism occurs as a rotational or pseudo-rotational slide, e.g. where the displaced mass moves as a relatively coherent mass along a spoon-shaped (curved upward) failure surface with little internal deformation, while it is generally ineffective on translational slides on long, uniform planar slopes, or on flow-type landslides. \nIt should always be kept in mind that the resisting forces are also reduced, especially in the long term, as a result of the reduction in normal stress on the failure surface. It is therefore necessary to locate the excavation in such manner that the reduction in driving forces exceeds the reduction in resisting forces. The neutral line concept, described in fact sheet 2.0 on \u201cmitigation by modifying the slope geometry / mass distribution; general aspects\u201d can be used for a preliminary evaluation of the relative merits of the proposed excavation. \nGenerally it is most practical where it is necessary to remediate or prevent small slumps or small rotational failures, while at the same time maintaining a specific function. It is generally impractical and not necessary to carry out large scale substitution as would be necessary on large landslides.\nCompared to the simple removal of the landslide mass in whole (2.1) or in part (2.3), substitution affords long term surface protection to the excavated surface. However, the permeability of the lightweight fill is typically much higher than that of the original soil and special care must be paid to drainage, both at the surface and at the interface with the natural soil. \nThe main limitations of the technique relate to the following issues:\n\u00b7 Excavation and replacement with lightweight fill may actually destabilize the ground farther up-slope by ubdercutting;\n\u00b7 Excavation and replacement with lightweight fill increases safety factor by only a limited amount, which tends to decrease with time in low permeability saturated soils;\n\u00b7 Excavation results in large volumes of material to be disposed of off-site in a controlled manner, with attendant difficulties;\n\u00b7 Excavation may interfere with existing structures and services; This is potentially significant when considering this type of mitigation for \u201cpotential\u201d landslides, while on actual landslides the residual value of existing structures and facilities can be very low;\n\u00b7 Work on active landslides requires special care to ensure the safety of workers; in particular, it is necessary to assess the possibility of sudden accelerations and to have in place well drilled evacuation plans.\n\u00b7 Vibration necessary to compact certain lightweight fills may be detrimental to slope stability.

In these cases, this mitigation measure is typically supplemented by drainage and/or other mitigation measures.\nIt should always be kept in mind that when fill is placed on the landslide body itself, the driving forces are also increased. It is therefore necessary to locate the fill in such manner that the increase in resisting forces exceeds the increase in driving forces.

Thus, the most critical conditions typically occur during construction, when the Contractor is still on site and it is easier to respond to unexpected performance.\nButress fills are normally constructed of blasted quarry rock, boulders and cobbles and coarse gravel fill, which are relatively free draining. If fine grained material is used, it is essential to include a drainage layer at the interface between the buttress and the underlying natural soil (Figure 2)\nThis technique can be incorporated economically in highway or railway projects if it is possible to design the alignment to match the stabilization requirements, as was done for example with the Taren Landslide (Kelly and Martin, 1985)\nThe main limitations of the technique relate to the following issues:\n\u00b7 Filling may actually destabilize the ground farther down-slope;\n\u00b7 Satisfactory solutions may involve significant modification of the landscape and possible interference with water courses at the toe of the landslide;\n\u00b7 Filling may require large volumes of material, to be procured off-site; availability of suitable fill may limit application of this technique;\n\u00b7 Filling may interfere with existing structures and services; this is potentially significant when considering this type of mitigation for \u201cpotential\u201d landslides, while on actual landslides the residual value of existing structures and facilities can be very low;\n\u00b7 Filling on or at the toe of active landslides requires special care to ensure the safety of workers; in particular, it is necessary to assess the possibility of sudden accelerations and to have in place well drilled evacuation plans.\nExamples of large landslides stabilized by this technique (alone or in combination with other mitigation measures are provided by Gedney and Weber (1978); Edil (1992); Kropp and Thomas (1992).

This may be achieved by open ditches at the head of the slope.\nDitches on the main landslide body are used to dispose of local surface runoff and any water arising from deep drainage works. \nDifferent types of ditches are used to drain surface runoff. The cross-section of ditches is usually trapezoidal, although small ones may be V or U-shaped or semicircular; their dimensions vary according to the expected runoff, the need for open water storage, the risk of bank erosion, the need to accommodate the transit of construction or maintenance equipment and the available means for maintenance (Figures 1 and 2 and Table 1).\nTable 1: Typical dimensions of open ditches (ftp://ftp.fao.org/dicrep/fao/010/a0975e/a0975e.pdf)\nType of ditch\nDepth \n(m)\nBed width (m)\nSide slope \n(v:h)\nMaximum side slope (v: h)\nV-shaped\n0.3 to 0.6\n-\n1: 6\n1:3\nV-shaped\n>0.6\n-\n1:4\n1:3\nTrapezoidal\n0.3 to 1\nAs required\n1:4\n1:2\nDitch gradient should be at least 2% to ensure rapid flow away from the potentially unstable areas and to promote self cleaning from any windblown or other debris that would tend to accumulate, causing local blockage and spillage. \nDitches should be lined to minimize erosion and uncontrolled infiltration. The lining may consist of cast-in-place or prefabricated concrete, pitched stone (Figure 3), rip rap, gabion mattresses or baskets, speciality geotextiles or geocomposites, zinc coated steel or PVC half-pipes. Flexible, self-healing lining or pipes should be used in areas susceptible to cracking and movements.\nWhere permeable linings are used, this should be in association with an impermeable geomembrane to minimize infiltration. Geomembranes may also be used by themselves for temporary or emergency applications, but they are easily damaged by wind and direct sunlight and should not normally be used by themselves for permnnent applications. \nTechniques must be adapted to ground conditions and local technology; an example is provided by Anderson and Holcombe (2004; 2008) who describe the development and application at community level of good drainage practices with locally available, affordable technologies in St Lucia, West Indies, consisting of ditches lined with a specialised plastic, held in place by a wire mesh (Figure 4).", "design_text": "Ditches must have enough capacity to transport the drainage water in wet period; however they are sometimes made wider than needed in order to create more storage in the open water system.

The use of vegetation to mitigate these phenomena has long been common practice, The role of vegetation in mitigating soil erosion is described in section 1 and summarized in Figure 1. The role of vegetation in mitigating shallow landslides is twofold: vegetation contributes to slope stability through root reinforcement (mechanical function, discussed in fact sheet 5.1) and through rainfall interception and evapotranspiration (hydrological function, discussed here).\nGreenwood et al. (2007) highlight that vegetation may also result in increased suction (negative pore pressure) in unsaturated soil, potentially increasing the apparent cohesion of the soil.\nVegetation is widely believed to improve the stability of slopes, especially on steep slopes and with respect to superficial or shallow movements. However, it can take a long time to become effective at depth and it can also have negative effects, as summarized in Table 1 (Greenway 1987; Wu, 1995).\nTable 1: Mechanical and hydrogeological effects of vegetation on slope stability (Wu, 1995)\nProcess\nType\nEffect on stability\n1.

For closed canopy forests, the interception ranges from 10 to 50% of the total precipitation. The capacity of the canopy to intercept and store water differs among the ecosystems. It depends mainly on the leaf surface area. Conifer (needle leaved, e.g. pine) forests store around 15% of the precipitation, whereas deciduous (broad leaved) forest store from 5 to 10% of the precipitation.\nThe bark structure and architecture of stems and trunks influence the amount and direction of stemflow (water movement from stems to the ground). Trees and shrubs with small barks have greater stemflow (around 12% of the precipitation) than the rough-barked plants, such as conifer which release around 2% of the precipitation received by their stem (Chapin et al., 2002).\nCollison and Anderson (1996) developed a vegetation cover model (Figure 2). In the model, canopy interception is calculated by a subroutine which include these parameters.\n\u00b7 Canopy area per cell (m2/m2) \n\u00b7 Leaf index ratio (m2/m2)\n\u00b7 Maximum depth of canopy store (m)\n\u00b7 Stemflow rate (percent rainfall)\n\u00b7 Maximum evaporation rate (m/s).", "design_text": "", "reference": "Barker R.F.

They are most effective if applied over the entire reach of an unstable channel.\nChannel linings are usually made by masonry or stone pitching with high-quality concrete, preferably reinforced by steel fiber to resist abrasion; protruding boulder are set in the concrete to dissipate the energy of waterflow. Where required, boulders may be tied together by C chaped steel bars drilled and grourted ito adjacent boulders. \nCheck dams are small sediment-storage dams built across the channels of steep gullies to slow down the flow, dissipating part of the energy, to stabilize the channel bed, thus preventing or mitigating landslides caused by basal erosion. They are also used to control the frequency and volume of channelized debris-flows and/or to control ravelling and shallow slides in the source area of debris-slides. Channelized debris flows are associated with channel gradients over 25\u00b0 and obtain most of their volume by scouring the channel bed. \nCheck dams serve three purposes when installed in the channels (Chatwin et al., 1994):\nCheck dams can be constructed of timber cribs (Figure 2) or concrete cribs, concrete mortared rock or plain or stone faced reinforced concrete (Figure 3). Concrete mortared rock dams do not usually exceeed 8 m in height, whereas concrete or timber crib dams do not exceed 2 m.\nThe spacing of check dams along the channel depends on the natural and infill gradient of the channel infill and the dam height; as an example, a 2 m high dam in a 20\u00b0 degree channel with 10\u00b0 sloping channel infill will be spaced every 12 m. (Highlands and Bobrowsky, 2008).\nReference may be made to Popescu M.E., Sasahara K. (2009) for further discussion and examples of check dams for the mitigation of debris flows.\nChannel linings are usually less expensive than check dams, especially if a long reach is to be stabilized; check dams are preferable, however, if the banks are very unstable because a dam can be keyed into the bank, providing toe support, enhancing stability. Check dams are expensive to contruct and therefore are usually built only where necessary to protect vulnerable elements downstream.", "design_text": "Channel linings need to be designed to have adequate stability against disturbance by the current; current velocity and bank slope angle govern the minimum and median block size in rip rap and stone linings. The local stability of the lining will also need to be verified with respect to static equilibrium under various groundwater conditions. Where concrete slabs or equivalent systems are used, special care will need to be paid to relieving water pressures at the contact with the underlying soil, especially where the lining obstructs free drainage towards the channel.\nLateral stream erosion and scour by spillway water are the main drawbacks of check dams. To prevent check dam failure the following recommendations apply:\n\u00b7 During construction the wingwalls must be tied into the gully walls and the streambed to withstand backfill pressures and lateral scour; wingwalls should slope about 70% and extend a minimum of 1\u00f72 m into the banks;\n\u00b7 The foundation of the dam should have a minimum width of 1/3 the total height of the dam and be deeper than any scour holes likely to develop;\n\u00b7 Downstream aprons (Figure 3b) or stilling basins should be provided, where feasible; \n\u00b7 The dynamic equilibrium of the whole reach should be considered, remembering that sediment accumulated by check dams tends to be replaced by increased streambed erosion downstream.\n\u00b7 Backfilling the dam, rather than allowing it to fill naturally, reduces the dynamic loading on the structure and results in a more stable design. The slope of the backfill should be less than 1/2 the channel gradient. ", "reference": "Chatwin S.C., Howes D.E., Schwab J.W., Swanston D.N.

Tipical layouts of shallow trenches, with main and possibly secondary branches, and typical cross sections are shown in Figs. 1a, b, c, d (Urciuoli, 2008). \nTrenches should be excavated deep enough to intercept the regions of positive pore pressures. Shallow trenches can be excavated by means of an excavator up to a depth of approximately 5 m from the ground surface (Fig. 2). The width of the trench is dependent on the type of excavator being used and may vary from 0.5 to 1.0 m. In open areas, trenches can have sloping sides, the gradient of which is based on stability consideration (Fig. 3). Where there is not enough space, trench sides have to be formed to vertical and should be properly supported (Fig. 4). Guidelines on the design of lateral support to excavation are given in many publications, e.g. BS 6031:1981 (BSI 1981). However problems of trench instability can be reduced by opening up trenches in short lengths and backfilling the trench within a short time after excavation. (Urciuoli, 2008). Trenches need to have a high discharge capacity to avoid the saturation of the backfilling material or of the lower portion of it. This can be achieved providing a drainage layer of gravel materials or installing at the bottom of the trench a perforated pipe (with slots on the upper part). The perforated pipe should be wrapped with a geotextile to prevent the clogging of the slots by fine soil particles (Fig. 5). A compacted clay cover should be placed on the top of the trench to prevent ingress of surface water, which should be drained by means of a system of surface drainage network. The impermeable cover should have a minimum thickness of 0.5 m and should be compacted in layers (Fig. 5).\nTrenches should be constructed starting from the lowest point in the area to be drained, so that they can drain water during construction. Inspection wells that intercept the trenches should be installed to allow:\n\u00b7 monitoring of the working condition of the drainage system, possibly by measuring the flow;\n\u00b7 maintenance, possibly flushing of the perforated pipe.\nThe reduction of pore water pressure varies along the slope longitudinal section, the maximum decreasing occurs at a distance from the head trench equal to 3-4 times the space along the cross section. Therefore the length of trenches is usually extended 3-4 time the wheelbase outside the slide area.", "design_text": "The first step in the design of a drainage system is the determination of the pore pressure change that is required to increase the factor of safety of the slope to the design value. The next step is to design the geometric configuration of drains that will result in the required pore pressure change. \nThe design of drain trenches can be carried out by using numerical analyses or easily by adopting design charts.\nIn the first case drainage works is analysed by means of numerical codes (DEM or FEM) and the problem may be solved by taking soil stratigraphy and heterogeneity into account and by assuming climate conditions acting at the upper boundary. The pore pressures calculated along the critical sliding surface should be used in slope stability analysis. \nIn the second case, non-dimensional charts obtained for homogeneous soil and very simple geometric schemes are used to estimate pore pressure, lowered by drains. Design charts are a general tool: they cannot consider hydraulic conditions at ground surface according to a seasonal trend, which necessarily depends on typical climatic features of the region being considered. \nIn fact methods of analyzing the stabilization effect of drain trenches commonly available in the literature (e.g., Hutchinson 1977, Desideri et al. 1997) model the groundwater regime as a steady-state phenomenon (seepage), and assume the presence of a film of water at the ground surface. In areas where the weather is not very rainy, such as in southern Europe, this assumption underestimates the effects of drains on slope stability (Urciuoli, 2008). \nThe majority of design charts are used to obtain the geometric configuration from the global efficiency of the drainage system, determined as a function of the pore water distribution that guarantees the safety factor chosen by the designer.

Essentially only the technology to excavate the trench is different from that used for shallow trenches. Deep trenches can reach the maximum depth of 30 m and are excavated by means of grab shells (Fig. 2). The sides of the trenches, being vertical, should be supported by means of slurry, e.g. polymeric mud (Fig. 3), therefore costs increase very much respect to shallow trenches. \nBecause of the high depth, it is difficult to provide the good laying of the discharge pipe; moreover the volume of materials necessary to fill trenches is very large. Therefore new technologies are continuously advancing, for example drainage cage may be dropped directly inside the trenches. Two new types of technologies adopted conveniently for deep trenches are described below:\n\u00b7 Narrow trench fitted with a draining geocomposite with a high capacity collection surface, buried with slightly compacted excavated soil. This is a geocomposite consisting of a draining core combined with two geotextile filters with a socket at the base for fitting the drainage tube. The features of this system are: excellent filtering, constant hydraulic efficiency, good excavation volume and no soil to dispose of, total or drastic reduction of inert materials, higher output and extra safety in the yard. All these features make draining with this system an innovative technique compared to traditional systems. Vertically continuous draining is possible for deep trenches by combining this system with suitable draining composites by securing them and superimposing them by means of suitable, simple measures (Figs. 3a, b).\n\u00b7 Deep trenches can be carried out as panels constituted by \u2018\u2019aerated concrete\u2019\u2019: gravel with high permeability (10-1 m/s) and cement with a good compression strength (Fig. 4). The technology used is that used for diaphragms, therefore any depth can be reached. The panels usually have the plan dimensions: 0,8-1m x 2,5-3m; first the odd-numbered ones are constructed. This system characterized by \u2018aerated concrete\u2019 can be realized as secant piles as well (Fig. 4), but the previous technique is faster.\nAbout the maintenance and monitoring, the same consideration for the shallow drain system can be made.", "design_text": "", "reference": "BS: 6031 1981.

They are adopted in fine-grained soils and in fissured rocks. The schematic layout of horizontal drains, represented in typical longitudinal and cross sections, are shown in Figs. 1 a, b, c (Pun & Urciuoli, 2008). \nHorizontal drains involve drilling holes in the ground, drilled with a tricone or drag bit (Figs. 2, 3). The diameter of the hole is usually 100-120 mm. During drilling, flushing fluid such as bentonite mud, polymers, foam, water or air is required to reduce friction and aid the removal of the cuttings. A PVC slotted pipe, protected by a geo-textile to avoid the clogging with fine materials, is inserted in the hole (Fig. 4). The maximum length of horizontal pipes is around 100 m, but in some cases it has been possible to reach 300 m. Deposits of calcium, salts and iron oxide can block horizontal drains during operation; therefore regular maintenance by flushing the pipes with a high pressure water jet, should be programmed. In absence of maintenance, drain pipes cannot keep functioning for a long time (maximum 15-20 years). A good practice to reduce precipitation of calcite inside pipes consists of drilling the hole at an inclination slightly above horizontal, such that the pipe is not continuously submerged. Conversely, there are other chemical phenomena, favored by bacterial activity, that are due to aeration (Walker & Mohen 1987). At the portion of the horizontal drain near to the slope surface, it is recommended to use a 3-6 m long un-perforated pipe, grouted all around with cement, to prevent the penetration of tree roots into the pipe, which could block the water flow (Fig. 4). The timerequired for installation is approximately 100-200 m per day.", "design_text": "The design of horizontal drains can be carried out by using numerical analyses or easily by adopting design charts available in literature (see Di Maio et al.1988, Desideri et al. 1997, Pun & Urciuoli 2008).\nIn the first case drainage work is analysed by means of numerical codes (DEM or FEM) and the problem may be solved by taking soil stratigraphy and heterogeneity into account and by assuming a water flux depending on the climate condition at the upper boundary. In this way, pore pressures can be calculated along the critical sliding surface; then they can be used in slope stability analysis. \nIn the second case, non-dimensional charts obtained for homogeneous soil and very simple geometric schemes are used to estimate pore pressure, lowered by drains. Design charts are a general tool useful for general conditions: they cannot consider hydraulic conditions at ground surface according to a seasonal trend, which necessarily depends on typical climatic features of the region. In fact the methods for analyzing the stabilization effect of drain trenches commonly available in the literature assume the presence of a film of water at the ground surface. The major use of design charts consists of obtaining the geometric configuration from the global efficiency of the drainage system that is determined as a function of the pore water distribution that guarantees the safety factor chosen by the designer. \nBased on numerical analyses, Desideri et al.1998 proposed design charts for drains installed from the ground-surface, with the drain rows placed at the distance S along the maximum slope direction (if they are installed on two or more alignments); the distance along the direction normal to slope is indicated by i. L is the length of the slope where pore pressures are reduced by draining, D is the depth of the plane parallel to the ground surface on which the efficiency is evaluated, Xpd is the relative position of the drainage system respect the lower end of the longitudinal section L (Fig 5 a,b).\nIn the analysis, the following hypothesis are assumed: \n\u00b7 infinite slope;\n\u00b7 homogeneous soils and isotropic permeability;\n\u00b7 presence of a film of water at the ground surface;\n\u00b7 two-dimensional flow conditions (by assuming values of the ratio i/l<2); \n\u00b7 constant ratio d/l=0.02;\n\u00b7 flow parallel to the ground surface, as initial conditon.\nDesign charts have been developed by the authors for different slope angles, as a function of the ratios l/L, Xpd/L, S/L,. for one and two rows of drains. The design charts allow to obtain:\n\u00b7 the optimum design of system;\n\u00b7 the system efficiency;\n\u00b7 the time at which 90% and 50% of efficiency is reached.\nThe first step of the design procedure is to determine the maximum factor of safety corresponding to the atmospheric pore pressure distribution in the subsoil and then the increment of the factor of safety (relative to its initial value) that is necessary to assure a suitable level of safe of the slope. These two values of safety factors are the ingredients for the calculation of the long-term efficiency of the drain system. The following step is to design the geometric configuration of drains that will result in the required pore pressure change. A single level of drains is assumed initially. The values of L, D, Xpd are assigned and by using Figures 6c, d, 7c, d the lenght of drains, l, and then the efficency at long term are obtained. In this way it is possible to evaluate if the efficiency of the hypothized drain system is larger than the required value. If necessary, an increase in system efficiency can be achieved by increasing the lenght of the drains, but no significant benefits are obtained for values higher than l = 4 -5 D. The values of the time factor corresponding to 50% and 90% of efficiency are obtained from Figures 6a, b, 7a, b, .", "reference": "BS: 6031 1981. Code of Practice for Earthworks.

These pits will allow the drilling fluid to be collected and reclaimed to minimize cost and to prevent excessive waste. The first stage drills a pilot hole on the designed path (Fig. 2a) and the second stage enlarges the hole by passing a larger cutting tool known as the back reamer (Figs. 2b, 3b). The reamer's diameter depends on the size of the pipe. Throughout the drilling and reaming process the drilling is done with the help of a viscous drilling fluid. It is a mixture of water and, usually, polymer continuously pumped to the cutting head or drill bit to facilitate the removal of cuttings, stabilize the bore hole, cool the cutting head, and lubricate the passage of the product pipe. The third stage places the drain in the enlarged hole by means of the drill steel and is pulled behind the reamer (Fig. 3c) to allow centering of the pipe in the newly reamed path (Fig. 2c).\nThe equipment used in a directional drill operation (Figs. 3, 4, 5, and 6) depends on the size of the pipe, length of the run, and surrounding locations. For the large bores, a 100,000 pound pulling power drill is used with a reclaimer, excavator, and multiple pumps and hoses to move the fluid. The drilling steel is a 3-in. diameter pipe with male and female threads (Fig. 4). The head of the operation comes in multiple designs and depends on the rock or soil being penetrated. The drilling head (Fig. 6) has multiple water ports to allow removal of material. A talon bit involves the diamond tipped cutters. These allow for steering and cutting the material. Another head type is a mud-motor which is used in rocky landscapes (Fig. 6).\nTypically a small two-person crew is required including a drill operator and a tracker. The tracker directs the progress of the drill by using a hand held device that gathers data from a sonde located in the drill head just behind the bit. The advantages of this system are:\n\u00b7 the size of the worksite consists of two small entry and exit pits;\n\u00b7 the drain may be laid at the desired depth with no risk to the operator;\n\u00b7 the bore path can be directed to avoid buried obstacles or other utilities, or to follow an angled trajectory according to the particular requirements of the bore design;\n\u00b7 the installation is faster and safer with no need to back-fill the excavation.\nAn experimental application at Barton-on-Sea, UK, proved very successful. The drains were drilled from a starter pit in very stiff clay some distance away from the toe of the unstable seacliff. Once drilling had penetrated sufficiently below the toe of the cliff, the directional drilling was made to turn upwards to come out onto the main plateau at the top of the cliff, where the reamer and the perforated pipe werea fixed to the drillstring and pulled back to the starter pit. This arrangement allowed the drains to intercept several perched water tables in the stratified soil profile and to discharge by gravity. The minimal intrusiveness of the technquie is an added bonus, allowing installation in envioronmentally sensiive locations with minimal disruption.", "design_text": "The design of horizontal drains can be carried out by using numerical analyses or easily by adopting design charts available in literature (Di Maio et al.1988, Desideri et al. 1997, Pun & Urciuoli 2008).

They are necessary when the water table or landslide surface are deep and when the soil is not homogeneous but is characterized by horizontal layers of different permeability, among which more permeable ones must be captured. Wells are usually divided in (Fig. 1).\n\u00b7 wells of small diameter (< 800 mm);\n\u00b7 wells of medium diameter (1200 - 1500 mm);\n\u00b7 wells of large diameters (> 2m) or structural wells.\nSmall diameter wells can work without pumps or by means of pumps or siphons. The medium and large diameter wells usually allow the drawdown of the water by means of gravity drainage through the bottom and of the sub horizontal drains (well diameter >3 m) (Fig.1). The cost is higher than the other drainage systems, especially when pumping is necessary. The construction of small and medium diameter wells is the same and is described below. Large diameter wells are described in fact sheets 4.5.6 and 4.5.7.\nTechnology for small and medium diameter wells\nSmall and medium diameter wells consist of a drilled hole; a screen or slotted pipe section to allow entrance of ground water; a bottom plate; a filter to prevent entrance and ultimate loss of aquifer material; a riser to conduct the water to the ground surface; a check valve to allow escape of water and prevent back flooding and entrance of foreign material; backfill to prevent recharge of the formation by surface water; and a cover and some type of barricade protection to prevent vandalism and damage to the top of the well by maintenance crews, livestock, etc (Fig. 2).\nThe hole should be vertical so that the screen and riser can be installed straight and plumb. The hole is drilled large enough to provide a minimum thickness of 10 \u2013 15 cm, depending on the gradation, of the filter material. The methods of providing an open boring in the ground are:\n\u00b7 Standard Rotary Method (Fig. 3b): Standard rotary drilling consists of rotating a cutter bit against the bottom of a boring, while a fluid is pumped down through the drill pipe to cool and lubricate the bit and return the cuttings up the open hole to the ground surface. The fluid must be biodegradable, organic; no bentonitic clays are used in the drilling fluid.\n\u00b7 Reverse-Rotary Method: This method is generally considered to provide the most acceptable drill hole and should be used whenever possible for the installation of permanent wells. In the reverse-rotary method, the hole for the well is made by rotary drilling, using a similar cutting process as employed in standard rotary drilling except the drilling fluid is pulled up through the drill pipe by vacuum and the drilling fluid reenters the top of the open boring by gravity. Soil from the drilling is removed from the hole by the flow of drilling fluid circulating from the ground surface down the hole and back up the hollow drill stem from the bit. \n\u00b7 Bailing and Casing (Fig. 3a): Where standard or reverse-rotary drilling is not successful, especially in caving alluvial sands and unconsolidated palaeochannel deposits, an equally acceptable method of drilling consists of bailing while driving a steel casing into the hole to stabilise the boring walls. This method is economical in some materials, and it does not inject deleterious materials into the formation. Loose to medium dense, clean, granular materials can be bailed economically. Thin layers of cohesive materials, or cemented materials within the formation, can preclude the advance by bailing and may also produce smear along the sides of the drill hole which could impair free flow into the well. \n\u00b7 Bucket Augers: Under certain conditions drill holes for relief wells can be made with a bucket auger. The method has been successfully employed where cobbles up to 254 mm have been encountered. A bucket with side cutters is employed, and only water is used as the drilling fluid.\nOnce the boring is completed and the tools withdrawn, the well screen and riser pipe can be constructed at the site in varying lengths. The lengths of screen are connected together as they are lowered into the hole. The riser and screen sections should be centred in the drill hole by means of appropriate centring devices to facilitate a continuous filter around the well screen. Then the filter may be placed. A tremie should be used to maintain a continuous flow of material and thus minimise segregation during placement. After the tremie pipe or pipes have been lowered to the bottom of the hole, they should be filled with filter material and then slowly raised to keep them full of filter material at all times.", "design_text": "", "reference": "", "figure_captions": "[['Figure. 1) Classification of wells'], ['Figure 2) Typical small diameter well and well screen'], ['Figure 3) a) Cable percussion drilling; b) Rotary drilling', '(a)', '(b)'], ['Figure 3) a) Cable percussion drilling; b) Rotary drilling', '(a)', '(b)'], ['Figure 4) Well charateristic curve for a) confined acquifer, b) unconfined acquifer '], ['Figure 4) Well charateristic curve for a) confined acquifer, b) unconfined acquifer '], ['Figure 5) a) Well in an unconfined aquifer and Thiem equation , b) Well in confined acquifer and Thiem equation (Thiem, 1961)', ' (a) (b)'], ['Figure 5) a) Well in an unconfined aquifer and Thiem equation , b) Well in confined acquifer and Thiem equation (Thiem, 1961)', ' (a) (b)'], ['Figure 5) a) Well in an unconfined aquifer and Thiem equation , b) Well in confined acquifer and Thiem equation (Thiem, 1961)', ' (a) (b)'], ['Figure 5) a) Well in an unconfined aquifer and Thiem equation , b) Well in confined acquifer and Thiem equation (Thiem, 1961)', ' (a) (b)'], ['Figure 5) a) Well in an unconfined aquifer and Thiem equation , b) Well in confined acquifer and Thiem equation (Thiem, 1961)', ' (a) (b)']]", "img_src": "['SmallAndMediumDiameterVerticalWells_files/image001.png', 'SmallAndMediumDiameterVerticalWells_files/image003.png', 'SmallAndMediumDiameterVerticalWells_files/image005.jpg', 'SmallAndMediumDiameterVerticalWells_files/image007.jpg', 'SmallAndMediumDiameterVerticalWells_files/image009.jpg', 'SmallAndMediumDiameterVerticalWells_files/image011.png', 'SmallAndMediumDiameterVerticalWells_files/image014.png', 'SmallAndMediumDiameterVerticalWells_files/image016.jpg', 'SmallAndMediumDiameterVerticalWells_files/image018.png', 'SmallAndMediumDiameterVerticalWells_files/image020.png', 'SmallAndMediumDiameterVerticalWells_files/image022.png']"}}, {"model": "blog.structuralmeasures", "pk": 340, "fields": {"name": "ReliefOfArtesianPressure", "title": "VERTICAL SMALL DIAMETER (<800mm) WELLS \u2013RELIEF OF ARTESIAN PRESSURE", "category_id": 4, "category_description": "MODIFYING THE GROUNDWATER REGIME - DEEP DRAINAGE", "sub_id": 5, "tech_criteria_AtoF": "[[0, 0, 4, 2, 4], [8, 4, 4], [0, 6, 8, 8, 6], [0, 4, 8, 8], [2, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]]", "performance_and_reliability_criteria": "[8, 7, 7, 7, 8, 4, 1]", "description_text": "Relief wells, characterized by a small diameter (<800 mm) (Fig.1), may be used to reduce piezometric head in a confined aquifer.

They are not often used as a permanent mean of slope stabilization in fact this technology has been developed mainly in relation to the extraction of groundwater as a resource, but also in relation to structural dewatering problems. \nTheir main advantages and disadvantages are:\nadvantages: all types of wells can extract groundwater from locations where gravity methods are impractical. Their drainage capacity can be increased at any time by placing more wells. In the case of pumped wells, drainage performance may also be adjusted by altering the on/off switching levels, by increasing or decreasing the pumping rate, or hutting some pumps down (Forrester, 2000);\ndisadvantages: pumped wells require an on-going commitment for maintenance and intermittent or continuous operations. They are therefore only used if stabilization by drainage is essential, but no method of gravity drainage is feasible. Therefore the maintenance costs very much and influences the service-life and the good working of the wells.\nPumping system\nThe selection of the pumping plant will be influenced by the quantity of water to be extracted and the height to which it must be pumped to ground level. Typical details of three pumping systems that are most commonly used for dewatering, and consequently for slope stabilization, are:\nWellpoint (Fig.2a, 3a, 4a): this consists of a well screen set on the end of a 38 mm diasteel pipe. Several wellpoints are connected to a common pump through a header pipe at ground level. A wellpoint may be driven into the ground or placed in a borehole, but it is usually jetted into place to the required level. This is done by applying water pressure to the tip through a temporary jetting pipe, with a rubber ball valve that allows a jet of water to be directed downwards. The valve closes when the jetting pipe is removed and the direction of flow is reversed for groundwater extraction. The wellpoint\u2019s biggest disadvantage is that it works by suction and is therefore unable to raise water more than about 7.5 m. The maximum limit of drawdown: 3-4 m in silty fine sands, 5-5.5 m generally. It\u2019s common practice to use two pumps initially and then continue using one pump at a time with the second one available as a stand-by.\nEjector (Fig.2b, 3b, 4b): also known as an eductor, this is placed in a cased borehole with a well screen as part of the casing. Its essential futures are a jet-the supply water-directed upwards through a venture. The venture is also open to the surrounding groundwater that has passed through the screen and into the casing. This water is carried with the supply water through the venture to the ground level. There, discharge in excess of the supply water flow is wasted. There are two different pipe arrangements. The first uses two pipes - one to lead the supply water to the ejector and the other to carry up the combined supply water and the groundwater. The other arrangement requires only a single pipe. The disvantages of an ejector are its high power consumption, since the same flow of supply water must be pumped continuously out of well for as long as pumping continues. Economically, it is not worth using it to raise water more than about 40 m. The advantage of the eductor system is that the water table can be lowered in one stage from depths of 10-45 m. However the efficiency of such system is lower than that of other pumping system. They become economically competitive in soils of relativity low permeability. Well diameter: 50 mm minimum-Well depth: up to 30 m.\nSubmersible pump (Fig. 2c, 3c, 4c): This type also required a cased boreholes with a well screen as part of the casing. The lowest component of the pump is an electric motor connected by a cable to the power source at ground level. Above the motor are the water inlet and pump screen, and the several pump rotors, one above the other. To prevent the motor from overheating, water must be kept moving past it while it is operating. Therefore, a switch that turns off the power at a lower water level is required. Submersible pumps are available in a wide variety of sizes and capacities. Switching is controlled by electrical contacts, similar in principle to those used to monitor waste levels in standpipe piezometers. A remote alarm system, also required for each pump, warns of pump malfunction or failure. The submersible pump is suitable for deep wells. Bore diameter: 150 mm to 500 mm - Well depth: up to 150 m.\nHowever in Figure 5 the application field of this pumping system is shown as a function of soil permeability and design drawdown", "design_text": "Each pump system can work up to a maximum depth. Wells are uneconomic compared to other drainage systems, especially when shallow depth must be reached; therefore well points are usually not adopted for slope stabilization. Deep wells (around 30 m) with submersible pumps are the most common system. \nThe type of pump to be adopted is a function of the pumping flow. Having determined how much the piezometric level must be lowered to obtain the required condition of slope stability, the flow is determined by means of the characteristic curve of the well (see fact sheet 4.5) or the Thiem equation. All suppliers provide the characteristic curve of their pumps to choose the most appropriate model and the optimum working point according to the design parameters. Typical submersible pump-characteristic curves are shown in the figure 6, for each pump type (motor type) at assigned diameter.\nDesign\nEach pump system can work up to a maximum depth.

It consists of isolated drainage wells of diameter 100 to 300 mm, equipped with a slotted PVC or a perforated or micro perforated steel pipe, with the annulus between pipe and soil filled with draining material, as explained in fact sheet 4.5.. The wells are pumped using a siphon driven by the fall in elevation of the slope (Fig. 2), overcoming the inconvenience of installing and operating a pump in each well. \nIts use in slope stability is restricted for two reasons (Forrester, 2000):\nA siphon is a familiar device for moving water from one level to a lower one; in its simplest form this consists of an inverted U-tube, both legs being full of water, and the flow is generally calculated by equating the total head producing flow, i.e. the difference of heads in the two reservoirs, h, to the sum of the frictional and other losses in the pipe and of the velocity head produced (for details see Citrini, Noseda 1986). System flow would decrease as h decreases due to drawdown in the well. Equilibrium would occur at the drawdown, yielding the system flow capacity. \nSiphons require priming (initial filling of line) to initiate flow. After priming, the siphon will passively convey liquid from the point of higher hydraulic head to the one of lower head indefinitely so long as the head differential is maintained and the prime is not lost. For flow tio be maintained, it is necessary that at all times:\n\u00b7 inlets and outlets are submerged, to prevent air from being drawn into the siphon line,\n\u00b7 gases which tend to accumulate in the siphon line as they come out of soultion due to the sub-atmospheric pressures. are removed\nIn fact, as the summit (minimum) pressure decreases, dissolved gases in the groundwater come out of solution and help form intermittent discontinuities as the pressure approaches a true vacuum. A break in the siphoning action occurs at a point less than the theoretical limit as the summit pressure continues to decrease.\nOne or both of the following methods may be used to remove the gases which have degassed from the liquid, thus maintaining full siphon flow:\n\u00b7 Maintenance of the minimum flushing velocity required to transport gases out to the end of the siphon.\n\u00b7 Use of air chambers at the siphon crest This makes the system less than entirely passive, since the chambers require periodic recharging.\nManagement of gas within the siphon line is considered to be of the greatest importance in the maintenance of siphon flow. Gas bubble transport, accumulation, agglomeration, and entrapment are controlled by fluid flow velocity, gas buoyancy, and siphon line grades and inside diameter discontinuities (i.e. fittings). Gas bubble transport in the upward leg of the siphon line is facilitated by higher fluid flow velocities, by a continuous upward siphon line grade (no localized high points), and the minimization or elimination of fittings which produce discontinuities in the internal diameter of the siphon line. The direction of gas bubble transport, if any, in the siphon line downward leg is determined by whether transport due to fluid flow velocity or gas buoyancy is dominant. In order to utilize the minimum flushing velocity to maintain full flow in the siphon line downward leg, the fluid flow velocity must be dominant in the downward leg. Additionally a continuous, downward, siphon line, grade (i.e. no localized high points) and the minimization or elimination of fittings which produce discontinuities in the internal diameter of the siphon line, is necessary.", "design_text": "", "reference": "Citrini D., Noseda G.(1986).

A typical plan and longitudinal section is shown in Figure 3.\nThe diameter of the wells is typically 1200 to 1500 mm. They can reach typical depths of 20 to 30 m and in particular cases more than 50 m (Beer et al, 1992, Manassero, 2001). They are excavated using the same equipment and techniques used for bored piles without bentionite mud (Figure 4). \nThe wells are typically of two types:\nStandard wells are filled with drainage material, simultaneously extracting the casing used for temporary support of the hole during drilling. The top of the well is sealed with say minimum 1.0m of impervious fill and topsoil to prevent infiltration of surface runoff.\nInspection wells are formed by installing in the well a permanent 1200 mm diameter corrugated hot galvanized steel casing perforated near the base (Figure 5), filling the annular space between the casing and the borehole with drainage material while extracting the temporary casing as above. These wells are placed at suitable distance along the array, typically one every three wells (Figure 3). Besides being used to drill the base conductor, inspection wells are used to monitor the correct performance of the system and in particular to measure and, if necessary, to regulate the flow rate.\nThe base conductor, which allows the wells to discharge by gravity, is the main feature of this technology.

However, it can take a long time to become effective at depth and it can also have negative effects, as summarized in Table 1 (Greenway 1987; Wu, 1995).\nTable 1: Mechanical and hydrogeological effects of vegetation on slope stability (Wu, 1995)\nInformation on the mechanical and hydrological effects of vegetation is provided by the Hong Kong Geotechnical Manual for Slopes (Geotechnical Control Office, 1984), reflecting one of the most comprehensive research programs in the world on the engineering role of vegetation for slope stabilization (Barker, 1991).\nThe net positive contribution of vegetation to slope stability is supported by a number of case studies where slope failures could be attributed to the loss of reinforcement provided by the tree roots (Wu et al., 1979; Riestenberg and Sovonick-Dunford, 1983; Riestenberg, 1987), while Greenwood et al. (2004) reported a 10% increases in the Factor of Safety of vegetated slopes compared to non-vegetated slopes.\nFrom a mechanical point of view, vegetation can improve the stability of slopes through the anchoring or reinforcement effect provided by the roots Wu (1995) \u2013 Figure 1. The governing factors are the mechanical properties (tensile strength and elastic modulus) of the roots and their density in the shear zone. The anchoring effect of roots depends on the type of vegetation; the roots have different properties and grow differently from plant to plant (Figure 2); a denser network of roots in the soil will fovour stability and for a given species the diameter of the roots will determine the amount of stress a root can take before breaking.\nNotable studies on the reinforcement effects of roots on vegetated slope have been conducted by Greenway et al. (1984), Greenway (1987) and Yin et al. (1988). Wu (1995) shows that roots left after logging continue to have a positive effect on slope stability for many years, with their tensile strength reducing gradually, but it takes time for new trees to establish a new stabilizing root system.\nGreenwood et al. (2007) highlight that vegetation may also result in increased suction (negative pore pressure) in unsaturated soil, potentially increasing the apparent cohesion of the soil.\nReference shall be made to the fact sheets in section 1 of this Annex for further detailed description of applicable techniques and discussion of the basis of design for the use of vegetation to improve slope stability.\nFor considerations on the hydrological effects of vegetation on soil stability reference may be made to fact sheet 3.5 of this Annex.", "design_text": "", "reference": "Barker R.F.

(1984), Greenway (1987) and Yin et al. (1988). Wu (1995) shows that roots left after logging continue to have a positive effect on slope stability for many years, with their tensile strength reducing gradually, but it takes time for new trees to establish a new stabilizing root system.', 'Greenwood et al.

It is possible to distinguish between:\n\u00b7 \u201cShallow\u201d substitution, where the unstable materials is partially or totally removed in bulk excavation and replaced with materials with adequate strength and permeability characteristics using standard earthworks equipment.

The development of geosynthetics and in particular of filter fabrics has provided a fast and economic solution to the problem of migration of fines from the underlying fine fill or natural soil to the gravel or stone fill. However, considering that typically the shear strength at the soil-geotextile interface is lower than within the soil itself, it is necessary to step the base of the excavation to prevent forming an artificial discontinuity where further sliding can take place.\nFor larger slides the use of imported high quality fill is expensive and implies a significant environmental impact, not only associated with the quarrying and transportation of the imported fill but also with the disposal of the excavated material. Accordingly, in larger slides the excavated soil is normally used to backfill the slide, relying on a number of techniques to prevent further sliding, where required.\nDrainage installed at the heel of the basal shear keys and drainage layers within and at the base of the backfill prevent future rises in pore water pressures in the backfill.\nIn clay, excavation and recompaction destroys the slip plane at the base of the slide, where only residual strength is available, and replaces it with homogeneous material; if necessary, the clay backfill can be improved by lime stabilization, both to ease handling and compaction and to improve its mechanical characteristics.\nAdditional reinforcement may be added to the backfill, effectively forming a reinforced soil structure, as described in greater detail in Section 7. This is especially useful where failure has occurred in very steep slopes, which cannot be reconstructed with standard fill.\nSisson (2010) describe a recent example of a major landslide repaired by substitution in Oceanside, California.", "design_text": "Shallow substitution", "reference": "Rogers J.D.

Compaction due to high static pressures from heavy equipment;\n2. Compaction due to vibratory equipment;\n3. Compaction due to heavy impact, using either eccentric rollers or dynamic compaction;\n4. Compaction due to pressure waves induced by blasts.\nAll systems aim to cause the soil grains to rearrange into a denser microstructure (fabric); they are effective only on unsaturated materials, with relatively low water content or, to a lesser extent, in free draining materials where pore water can readily escape (Forssblad, 1981)\nImpact compaction, dynamic compaction and blasting are not considered further, since they are not applicable to landslide stabilization because the very high levels of energy involved could itself trigger movement and because of the intrinsic difficulties of applying these techniques on sloping ground. In fact, even vibratory compaction needs to be applied with caution in certain conditions. There are reports of landslides in quick clay triggered by construction-induced vibrations. Vibration from compaction may also cause nuisance and in extreme cases damage outside the zone of application, to a distance of several tens of metres.\nHigh pressure compaction\nSurface compaction is generally achieved by driving heavy equipments repeatedly on the soil. Different types of equipment have been developed for this purpose.\nThe simplest equipment consists of a heavy duty machines or towed units with regular tires, referred to as \u201cpneumatic rollers\u201d (Figure 1a); these compactors may commonly be as heavy as 500 to 2000 kN. As these compactors run slowly on the ground, the top soil gets mechanically compacted by the temporary increased vertical stresses.\nOther equipment, referred to as \u201csheep\u2019s foot roller\u201d (Figure 1c), has been designed to penetrate into the shallow soil to get better compaction; the penetrating parts result in a smaller contact surface to the soil and thus in higher pressures applied; pressures as high as 4.2 MPa may be achieved by the heaviest equipments in common use. The penetrating method is applicable only in presence of fine grained materials, resulting ineffective in coarse grained materials. In clay, these rollers prevent the formation of pre-sheared surfaces sub-parallel to the compaction surface, which can be highly deleterious to stability.\nVibratory compaction \nVibratory compactors are available with vibrating drums (Figure 1d), pneumatic tires or plates (Figure 1b). These compactors use high frequency, low amplitude vertical oscillations in addition to high vertical stresses due to their high weight. In this way the material is shaken and brougth into a more dense state.\nAs for the non-vibratory equipments, the smoot surface equipments are best suited to compact coarse grained materials; padded or \u201clagged\u201d equipments, like a vibratory \u201csheep\u2019s foot roller\u201d, are best suited for fine grained materials. \nEven in optimal conditions, with these methods the maximum thickness of improvement is less than 2 m and more often less than 0.5 to 1.0 m, hence the applicability of these methods to slope stabilization work is limited.\nThe high weigth of the equipments is also a limitation. Heavy rollers (static and vibratory) are designed to operate on quasi-level ground; they become relatively ineffective and difficult to operate on sloping ground. On relatively short slopes they can operate along the line of maximum slope assisted by a winch securely anchored at the top of the slope, but this severely limits their operation and may have safety implications.", "design_text": "", "reference": "Forssblad L.

The maximum depth of compaction is typically limited by the lifting equipment. Depths up to 70 metres have been achieved (Moseley and Kirsch, 2004; www.vibroflotation-ng.com). \nDeep compaction is normally achieved according to the following steps (Figure 1.):\n1. A probe is penetrated to the desired depth under its own weight with minimal vibration and with the assistance of high pressure water jet from the tip of the probe, progressively displacing the soil beneath it (Figures 2 and 3).\n2. At the desired depth the vibroprobe is activated, oscillating laterally and transferring vibrations horizontally into the surrounding soil, compacting it. The area of influence depends on several factors, mainly the mechanical characteristics of the vibroprobe, the target relative density to be achieved, the nature of the soil and groundwater levels. Guidance on what can be achieved with standard equipment is provided by Elias et al. (2001). A spacing of 3 m is typically adopted when using standard equipment in favourable conditions .\n3. The vibroprobe is slowly raised towards the surface while vibrating. The overlaying soil will gradually sink in, as the lowermost material is densified (Figure 4). Additional sand is usually dropped into the hole to ensure full compaction of the area.\nDeep compaction due to vibration may also be achieved penetrating a hollow steel tube into the soil, a method referred to as Terra-Probe; the steel tube is vibrated down to the desired depth and then drawn up again while the hollow steel tube is vibrating; this procedure is repeated several times to get the required degree of compaction. In this technique the vibrator is mounted on the top of the stell tube and imparts vertical, rather than horizontal vibration, resulting in a much smaller area of influence. A spacing of 1.5 m is typically adopted when using the Terra-Probe equipment in favourable conditions; the greater quantities are compensated in part by the greater speed compared to vibrofloatation.\nNotwithstanding the addition of material at each treatment point during compaction, in both cases settlement is normally induced by vibration, which can be compensated either by overfilling with clean granular soil prior to compaction or by conventional filling and compaction at the end of treatment, if required.\nAccording, for example to Bergado et al. (1999) and Mc Carthy (2007), clay and silty content should be less than 15 to 20% for the method to be effective. Higher contents of silt and clay will limit the ability of water to drain away rapidly and may result in the sides of the hole not \u201ccollapsing\u201d promptly onto the probe, reducing the effectivness of energy transfer from the probe to the surrounding soil, thus limiting the compaction process. Gravel content should be less than 20%; higher gravel contents may limit the ability of the probe to penetrate the soil to be compacted, thus limiting the maximum depth of treatment to, say, 10 m depth.\nGreat caution is necessary when performing deep compaction near existing services or structures, to limit settlements, and below the groundwater level, to limit the resulting excess pore pressures not to trigger local or general instability. \nProvided vibrocompaction is carried out properly and with the appropriate spacing between treatment points, the treated soil may be considered as a continuous medium with improved and more homogeneous mechanical characteristics; in particular, as a consequence of the increase of density, both stiffness and strength are increased.\nStone columns\nStone colums consist of underground colums of crushed rock or gravel, installed by techniques similar to those adopted and described above for vibrocompaction. Stone columns are adopted where vibrocompaction ceases to be effective, e.g. where silt and clay content is higher than 15 to 20%. Two different methods can be adopted to form stone columns, e,g, vibroreplacement and vibrodisplacement. In both cases, stone columns reinforce all the layers crossed, including un-compactable layers. Depending on the nature of the soil and the particulars of the technique used, their installation may also result in the compaction of the original soil between columns.\nVibroreplacement can be carried out using either a wet process (water jet) or a dry process (air jet); normally the wet method is more effective. Besides the vibroprobe and the supporting crane, which are essentially the same used for vibrocompaction, the spread of equipment includes a compressor and a wheel loader (Figure 6).", "design_text": "", "reference": "Barker R.F.

It is typically performed by specialist rotary equipment with mixing blades, which are inserted into and removed from the ground nominally without soil extraction while the admixture is injected from nozzles in or near the blades (Figure 1). The hydraulic conductivity of the treated soil will be higher or lower than that of the parent soil, depending on the soil type and admixture used. The admixture consists of stabilizing binders that react chemically with water, resulting in cation exchange on the surface of clay minerals or bonding of soil particles and/or filling of voids (Terashi, 2003). The most common binders are cement or lime; other materials like gypsum or fly ash are also used (Moseley and Kirsch, 2004).\nThe method is best suited to soft fine grained materials of relatively low shear strength and is applicable down to a depth of 30 m. The effect on slope stability depends on the type of soil being treated, the layout and spacing of the inclusions, the type of admixture used and the equipment and method of mixing (Mc Carthy, 2007).\nResearch and development of deep mixing as it is known today started in Japan and in Sweden in the late 1960\u2019s using blades rotated by a single vertical shaft and lime as a binder, with the first applications being impleneted in the mid 1970\u2019s. Since then there have been significant developments in all aspects of the technology.\nDifferent equipment and procedures have been developed to respond to different soil conditions and performance requirements. Figures 2 and 3 show typical equipment developed in Scandinavia, consisting of relatively lightweight rigs and trailers loaded with dry binder. This equipment is suitable for treating extremely soft, \u201cquick\u201d soil, which can be mixed satisfactorily with very lightweight, fixed blades (Figure 4); dry binder is used, reacting with the soil pore water. Heavier, stiffer soils, possibly mixed with silt or even granular soils, require more robust, heavier equipment with a mix of rotating and fized or even counter-rotating blades to break up lumps (Figure 5). A thick slurry of binder is normally used in these soils (wet method). The selection of dry versus wet soil mixing is normally made on the basis of the natural water content and undrained shear strength of the natural soil, dry mixing being preferred where the natural moisture content of the soil is greater than 60% and its undrained strength less than 70-75 kPa.\nA further development in single shaft technology has been the introduction of composite systems which combine deep mixing and jet grouting techniques. The jet grouting nozzles are located on the outer edge of the mixing blade (Figure 6) such that the completed column has a mechanically mixed core and a jet grouted annulus (Figure 7). \nMulti-rotary equipment (Figure 8) has been developed primarily to allow simultaneous installation of 2 or more secant circular columns to form wall panels of mechanically mixed stabilized soil for the construction of temporary or permanent walls. These systems have the added benefit that mixing is much enhanced by the action of counter-rotating blades on adjacent, compenetrating, columns (Figure 9). An additional benefit specific to landslide mitigation or remediation is that panels are much better than isolated columns in resisting landslide loads, as discussed in fact sheet 5.0.\nThe need to form panels has driven the development of radically different approaches, deviating from the technology based on blades rotating around the vertical axis. Discrete panels or barrettes can be formed by two cutter/mixer heads counter rotating around horizontal axes (Figures 10, 11 and 12). Continuous walls can be formed, but only to a limited depth, by a continuous chain cutter/mixer (Figures 13and 14). In all cases the dimensions of the resulting inclusions are the same as those of the mixer (auger or cutter).\nThe method may be applicable with caution to sensitive clay since probably the installation process does not induce significant pressure in the surrounding material and the temporary change in slope stability may probably be disregarded.", "design_text": "Unless mass treatment is carried out, which is highly unusual, the verification of effectivness of the treatment is complex, since it refers to the behaviour of a discontinuous mass. It can only be addressed by applying significant simplifications. Available simplified methods are based on limit equilibrium (in static and seismic conditions):\nThe properties of the inclusions are pre-determined from laboratory tests carried out at different confining pressures to determine the strength envelope of the treated soil in terms of both total and effective stress. Bearing in mind that due to inmperfect mixing filed strengths are typically only 35 to 50% of the strength measured in laboratory tests, the actual strength of the treated soil needs to be verified by trial fields and control tests.", "reference": "Idriss, I.M., Boulanger, R.W.

Jet grouting is described in fact sheet 5.7, while displacement and fracture grouting are not generally applicable to slope stabilization.\nThe most common grout materials are cement, microfine cement, lime, gypsum, sodium silicate chemicals and polymers (Warner, 2004; Mc Carthy, 2007). Different grout materials have different viscosity; the more viscous materials, such as cement grouts, are used for coarse grained soil and rock masses with open fractures; the less viscous materials, such as the chemical grouts, are used for fine grained materials (Figure 2). Indicatively, Ordinary Portland cement may be used in soils with D10 > 0.6 to 1.0 mm, while microfine cements may be used in soils with D10 > 0.08 to 0.1 mm. (Mitchell, 1981; Townsend and Anderson, 2004). Chemical grouts may be used in even finer soils. The most common chemical grout used for structural applications is sodium silicate. Other chemical grouts are acrylates and polyurethanes. In 1997 a release of acrylamide into the groundwater caused serious environmental problems in the area of the Hallandas Tunnel, near Baastad in Sweden (Lofstedt, 1999; Littlejhon, 2003), leading to the withdrawal of this chemical from the market. Since then the materials used in chemical grouts come under very close scrutiny for their potential environmental effects. \nThe process of injection is usually done by a movable injection rig according to the following steps and the same procedures apply for all methods of grouting and injection material:\n1. An injection pipe is inserted into the ground to the required depth, either by static pressure (in loose soils) or more commonly by lowering it into a predrilled hole. Drilling is normally carried out by rotary/percussive or more commonly by percussive methods. Careful consideration is required in the selection of the appropriate flushing medium.\n2. Typically the grout is injected from the end of the injection pipe while the pipe is withdrawn, either continuously or in predetermined discrete intervals for the full thickness of interest, resulting in vertical or inclined continuous columns of soil with improved characteristics, e.g. increased stiffness and strength and reduced permeability. \n3. The procedure is carried out in several holes, usually in a close grid pattern. If the injection grid is made with small spacing the ground treatment may becomes \u201ccontinuous\u201d also in the horizontal direction.\nAlternative procedures include injection through a pipe in an open hole sealed at the surface or through a grout pipe left in place as \u201ctube a\u2019 manchette\u201d, although the latter is seldom used for low pressure grouting in stabilization projects, where the geometry of the grouted mass is not critical.\nTo ensure that the injections do not disturb the in-situ structure of the soil, special care is required in adjusting injection rates and pressures, as too high rates and pressures may displace grains or even worse result in hydraulic fracturing.\nTo confirm the geometry and effectiveness of treatment, injections rates, pressures and volumes must be accurately monitored and recorded, in association with corings for inspection and testing of the treated soil.\nGrouting can be used to stabilize rock masses (Figure 3), for selective treatment of weak soil layers at depth or for stabilizing coarse grained soils susceptible to liquefaction related phenomena When grouting is carried out in slopes, drainage must be provided to avoid build up of pore water pressures behind the treated area.", "design_text": "", "reference": "Andrus R.D., Chung R.M.

The resulting material is often referred to as soilcrete, especially when jet grouting is carried out in coarse grained soils.\nJet grouting is carried out as follows:\n1. An injection pipe is pushed or drilled into the ground to the desired depth.\n2. Grout is injected laterally at high speed from a nozzle located near the end of the pipe into the soil while the pipe is continuously rotated and gradually withdrawn, either continuously or, preferably, in small discrete steps. The procedure is carried on until the whole unstable layers are covered. Three basic systems may be adopted (Figure 1.): single (grout), double (grout and air) and triple fluid (grout, air and water).\n3. The procedure is repeated at several locations at a predetermined spacing, usually in a close grid pattern; secant inclusions may be used to form nominally continuous panels where required for stability (see fact sheet 5.0) or for groundwater exclusion.\nThe addition of air in double and triple fluid systems isolates the eroding jet (grout or water respectively) from the surrounding soil, to achieve greater depths of erosion and thus larger inclusions. Triple jet systems minimize the amount of grout used for erosion. \nJet-grouting may replace a large amount of soil mass; the columns diameter depends on the soil to be treated and on the system used (mono, double or triple fluid); it is typically 0.4 to 2 m for fine grained soils and 0.5 to 3 m for coarse grained soils (Nikbakhtan et al., 2010). Optimization of the nozzle geometry and the use of very high pressure pumps allows the formation of very large inclusions, up to 3 to 5 m wide in the most favourable conditions (Figure 2, Shibazaki, 2003, Mc Carthy, 2007).\nIn order to achieve the high jet speeds necessary to erode the surrounding soils, the eroding fluid is injected at very high pressure. The pressure is converted into speed at the nozzle and does not materialize in the soil-fluid mix nor in the surrounding soil, provided that a clear outlet is maintained at all times allowing excess fluid and spoil to flow to the surface under low pressure gradients. Severe heaving and/or lateral displacements may occur if this flow is interrupted. To minimize this risk, a cased hole is used in soils where the probehole is prone to instability. The casing is withdrawn simultaneously with the drill string.\nJet grouting inevitably generates large amounts of spoil; in normal conditions the volume of spoil is roughly equivalent to the volume of the inclusion formed. The spoil is a thick soil/grout slurry, not suitable for dry handling (Figure 3).\nJet-grouting is applicable for the whole range of soils and may be applied to any depth down to 50 m (Mc Carthy, 2007); it can be ended at any depth, making it possible to treat only the unstable zone (Jaritngam, 2003). \nVery stiff cohesive soils of high plasticity and boulders pose special problems and may limit the applicability of the technique. Active movement may be accelerated by the jet grouting treatment works.", "design_text": "Jet grouted columns act as reinforcement having much better mechanical characteristics than the surrounding soil. \nUnless mass treatment is carried out, which is highly unusual, the verification of effectivness of the treatment is complex, since it refers to the behaviour of a discontinuous mass. It can only be addressed by applying significant simplifications.\nAvailable simplified methods are based on limit equilibrium (in static and seismic conditions). \nThe properties of the inclusions are pre-determined from laboratory tests carried out at different confining pressures to determine the strength envelope of the treated soil in terms of both total and effective stress. Bearing in mind that due to inmperfect mixing filed strengths are typically only 35 to 50% of the strength measured in laboratory tests, the actual strength of the treated soil needs to be verified by trial fields and control tests.\nWhere the surrounding soil is clay, it can be modelled in terms of undrained shear strength, with appropriate reductions in case of cyclic loads (see for example Idriss and Boulanger, 2008).

Ramiah (1970) reported variations in the residual angle of friction j\u2019r of about 4\u00b0. Similar conclusions were reached by Kenney (1977), Moore (1991), Di Maio (1996a, 1996b), Maggi\u00f2 et al. (2002) for various pure and natural clays and by Steward and Cripps (1983) for pyritic shale. \nMoore (1991) carried out a systematic laboratory investigation of this issue and reported that clays saturated with monovalent sodium cations consistently resulted in lower residual strengths than clays saturated with calcium divalent cations. The type of cation can account for changes in residual strength of up to approximately 40% for montmorillonite and 15% for kaolinite clay minerals.\nThe concentration of salts in in the pore water was found to result in furhter differences in residual strength. Moore (1991) also showed that increasing concentrations of seawater result in increasing residual strength in natural clays too, suggesting that seasonal fluctuations in the concentration of salts in pore water can modify the residual strength of natural calys. This observation, which can be particularly significant for coastal landslides, is corroborated by field observations (Moore, 1988; Moore and Brunsden, 1996).\nMesri and Olson (1971) showed that the void ratio of clay samples decreased when subjected to a long term increase in the concentration of NaCl, thus increasing consolidation and stability. NaCl are especially known for long term stability of sensitive clays as the presence of cations change the surface tension on the clay minerals. Long term leaching of NaCl destabilizes clays and when the content of NaCl becomes too low the clay becomes quick (NGU, 2002). In spite of this it is not found that NaCl is used for increasing stability of clays by groundwater exchange.\nInstead, the most common technique for lowering landslide susceptibility by modification of groundwater chemistry is to add lime to the soil, often creating lime columns in the ground. The methods for creating lime columns in the ground are the same as described for mechanical deep mixing, permeation grouting and jet grouting.\nLime-stabilization has been applied especially to soft and sensitive clays (Rogers and Glendinning, 1997). \nIt is widely reported that lime migrates from the columns, stabilizing also the surrounding clay. Stabilization is achieved due to formation of calcium silicate hydrate and calcium aluminate hydrate; both gels crystallize in the pores of the clay (Rogers and Glendinning, 1996). The migration has been reported over great distances, probably due to hydraulic gradients. Bell (1996) investigated the effect of lime stabilization on both clay and till and found that till did not show any significant increase in stability to tratment with lime. Migration of ground water into lime columns has also been observed.\nThe effects of lime columns in clay may be summarized as follows (Rogers and Glendinning, 1997):\n\u00b7 Increased strength of an annular zone of clay surrounding the columns, caused by lime-clay reaction;\n\u00b7 Clay dehydration;\n\u00b7 Generation of negative pore-water pressure;\n\u00b7 Over-consolidation of the soil in the shear plane;\n\u00b7 Columns strength.\nThe stabilization of an embankment of loose clay shale fill was attempted in Thailand in 1977. Lime piles were installed in a regular grid with a spacing of 3 m (Figure 1). Holes 15 cm in diameter were augered by hand down to natural hard ground, and lime and water were poured into the holes and topped up daily for two months.\nBased on measurements at four locations, Ruenkrairergsa and Pimsarn (1982) report a significant change in soil properties two years after installing the lime piles: the water content of the clay decreased by up to 6.0 %, the cohesion increased by up to 15.7 kN/m\u00b2 and the friction angle increased by up to 8.1\u00b0.", "design_text": "", "reference": "Bell F.G.

Trench drains are commonly used to stabilize landslides of small to moderate depth in clay slopes. They contribute to slope stability only through their drainage action, as discussed in detail in the relevant fact sheets. If trench drains are deep enough to intersect the basal failure plane, they provide additional mechanical stabilization, by the replacement of the weak slipped material by the stronger material in the drain, thus improving the average shear resistance that can be mobilized on the failure plane for any given pore pressure regime (Lee and Clark, 2002). While deep trench drains intersecting the failure plane are generally referred to as \u201ccounterfort drains\u201d, the term is often used loosely to indicate trench drains aligned along or close to the direction of maximum inclination of the slope, irrespective of whether they do or do not intersect the slip plane. \nOne of the earliest formally reported applications of counterfort drains to stabilize landslide is the construction of deep gravel filled counterfort drains through the shear surface to the undisturbed clay below to remediate rotational movements observed in London Clay in railway cuttings at New Cross (Gregory, 1844). \nDeep counterfort drains are reported by Tianchi (1996) to be the main measure used to treat small and medium scale landslides because of the combined benefits of the drainage and mechanical effects.\nMany slip planes are less than 5 m deep and counterfort drains can be excavated to 6 m deep using hydraulic backactor excavators; greater depths up to 7 or 8 m deep can be reached using machines equipped with long reach booms. They are typically 0.5 to 1.0 m wide and they are back-filled with suitable free-draining material. They are design as invertes filters, with a gravel core surrounded by sand, to prevent them becoming chocked with fines, which renders them ineffective. Geotextile filters are widely used for this purpose to simplify construction. A porous pipe may be placed at the base to collect and remove the water. Provision to prevent clogging must be incorporated in the design. The mechanical benefits are increased if free draining concrete is used in lieu of the gravel fill.", "design_text": "For the hydraulic aspect of the design, reference shall be made to the relevant fact-sheets.\nProvided the length, thickness and spacing of the counterfort drains are such that load transfer from the sliding mass to the counterforts and from the these to the underlying stable soil is guaranteed, the mechanical benefit of partially replacing the shear surface with more competent material may be taken into account simply by calculating the post construction average strength as the weighted average strength of the original soil and the drain material.\nClearly, this is most effective when remediating pre-existing planar slides in clay, which often exist close to limit equilibrium and are cyclically reactivated. Assuming a residual angle of friction on the failure plane equal to 14\u00b0 and an angle of friction of the drain material equal to 32\u00b0, a replacement ratio of 20% would result in a 30% improvement in the factor of safety of the slope. Clearly, lower replacement ratios are sufficient to provide a similar result if the drainage effect is also taken into account.", "reference": "Carter P. (1992) \u201cDewatering\u201d.

Construction of the annular structure which is necessary to ensure that subsequent activities can be carried out safely;\n2. Excavation to the design depth, as necessary to ensure that each caisson is adequately keyed into the underlaying competent and stable strata;\n3. Backfilling with reinforced concrete (mass concrete may be used in relatively short, large caissons where shear behaviour predominates).\nDepending on anticipated ground and groundwater conditions, the most common techniques used to form the annular structure constructed in the first stage are (De Paoli, 1989; Tambara, 1999):\n\u00b7 Progressive construction during excavation by alternate excavation and casting of consecutive concrete rings, although this may be problematic in unstable slopes.\n\u00b7 Advance formation of an annular structure by means of micropiles, jet grouted columns, piles or diaphragm walls, which is later supplemented by annular steel or concrete ribs as excavation proceeds.\nWhere ground conditions vary significantly along the depth to be excavated, different techniques can be used for different portions of the structure: for example by performing the annular structure to rockhead only and extending the excavation into rock with local support only.\nSpecial care needs to be paid when excavating below the groundwater level, especially if more permeable ground is overlain by less permeable ground and/or where running conditions may occur. Temporary dewatering is necessary in these conditions and in extreme cases they may make this technique inapplicable.\nThe main advantages of this technique may be summarized as follows:\n\u00b7 Very stiff and robust structure;\n\u00b7 Applicable in deep landslides (up to 20\u00f725 m deep) where other techniques may prove inadequate;\n\u00b7 Main structural components are constructed under controlled, clean conditions, allowing inspection of reinforcement and controlled placement and compaction of concrete;\n\u00b7 May be adapted to suit a variety of ground conditions below the sliding mass, including rock;\n\u00b7 Allow installation of anchors and/or suborizontal drains from within the caissons, several metres below ground level;\n\u00b7 Allow direct inspection of sliding mass and underlying competent strata during construction.\nOn the contrary, it must be borne in mind that construction may take several months and it requires access roads and a level working platform for safe operation, which on relatively steep ground may require significant preliminary works.", "design_text": "The design load on the caissons may be determined in 2D limit equilibrium analyses by calculating the reaction on the vertical section corresponding to the caisson alignement which is necessary to guarantee, with the appropriate factor of safety, the stability of the portion of the slide located upslope of the wall in the absence of the downslope portion; in any case, the load on the wall cannot exceed passive soil pressure.\nThe contribution of the downslope portion can be considered only if this portion remains stable with an appropriate factor of safety once the driving force from the upper portion is removed; even in this case, it may be prudent to consider this mass only as confinement for the stable soil below, since even very small deformation such as shrinkage in a dry season may be sufficient to reduce or completely remove downslope support to the caissons.\nThe design loads and the stability of the downslope portion in seismic conditions are normally determined from pseudostatic limit equilibrium analyses, taking into account the excess pore pressures that may develop in the slope, where applicable.", "reference": "Brandl H.

The face of the slope is protected by shotcrete and welded wire mesh, geogrid/geotextiles sheets and cast-in-place concrete or prefabricated panels. \nThe technique has been developed in France, Germany and United States over the past 25 years or so (Guilloux and Schlosser, 1985; Nicholson, 1986; Bruce and Jewell 1986a; 1986b; Munfach et al.; 1987; Juran and Elias, 1987; Gnilsen, 1988, Recommendations Clouterre, 1991; Byrne et al., 1998; Mitchell and Jardine, 2002; Phear et al., 2005), as a development of the \u201croot piles\u201d technique originally developed in the 1950\u2019s described by Lizzi (1977); Bruce (1992a, b). Its application has extended to a wide variety of ground types, from soils to weathered and un-weathered rocks; while the term \u201cground nail\u201d might be a more suitable generic term, \u201csoil nail\u201d has become established as the commonly accepted generic terminology and is used here for nails installed in all types of ground which can be conveniently described as continuoum. Case histories are listed for example in Bruce and Jewell (1987a; 1987b) and Bruce (1989).\nA typical construction sequence for drilled and grouted nails is described below and shown in Figure 1; alternative methods of installations include percussive methods or vibro-drilling (Myles and Bridle, 1991), combinations of vibration driving with injections and driving nails by compressed air or pyrotechnic launchers A typical application is shown in Figure 2.\n1. Installation of ditches to intercept and divert surface water; exacavation/trimming in stages of limited height (typically 1 or 2 m), minimizing ground disturbance and removing loosened areas, leaving a working bench of 5\u00f77 m width. For installation in existing slopes, special provision must be made for access (long reach booms, sledges or similar). \n2. Dilling of nail holes at predetermined locations to a specified length and inclination using drilling methods appropriate for the ground, supporting the drillhole with casing, if required, although this will often have serious adverse impact on the cost effectiveness of soil nailing. Bentonite or other mud suspensions should not be used, as \u201csmear\u201d on the drillhole walls can significantly reduce the grout-to-ground bond. Typical drillhole size: 100 to 300 mm; spacing: 1 to 2 m, both vertically and horizontally; inclination: 15\u00b0 below horizontal to facilitate grouting; length: 6 to 15 m (up to 28 m using large hydraulic-powered track-mounted rigs with continuous flight augers).\n3. Installation and grouting of nails. Plastic or steel centralizers are commonly used to center the nail in the drillhole; stiffer grout mix may be alternatively used to maintain the position of the nail and prevent it from sinking to the bottom of the hole. The steel nails are commonly 25 to 50 mm in diameter; solid or hollow; the yield strength is 420 to 500 N/mm2. Steel nail diameter smaller than 25 mm are not recommended due to difficulties associated with placement of such flexible tendons in drilled holes. Grouting takes place under gravity or low pressure from the bottom of the hole upwards. Grouted steel nails protected only by the grout annulus are not generally considered adequate for permanent application in some countries; in this cases, additional protection against corrosion may be given by sacrificial thickness, by heavy epoxy coating and by encapsulating it in a grout-filled corrugated plastic sheathing. \u201cSelf-drilling nails\u201d (Figure 3) can be used where open hole drilling is not possible or practical. However, they require special corrosion considerations and testing procedures to be considered for permanent applications. In general the self-drilling nails should not be used in aggressive ground (as defined in Byrne et al., 1998) and coatings should not be considered acceptable corrosion protection, which can be assured only by providing sacrificial steel.\n4. Placement of drainage system and installation of the construction facing and of the bearing plates. Prefabricated synthetic drainage mats are placed in vertical strips (about 400 mm wide) between the nail heads at horizontal spacing equal to that of the nails. The drainage strips are extended down to the base of the structure and connected either directly to a footing drain or to weep holes that penetrate the final wall facing. If water is encountered, short horizontal drains are generally required to intercept the water before it reaches the face. The construction facing typically consists of a mesh-reinforced shotcrete layer of the order of 100 mm thick. Following placement of the shotcrete a steel bearing plate (typically 200 mm x 250 mm square and 20 mm thick) and securing nut are placed at each nail head and the nut is hand wrench tightened sufficiently to embed the plate a small distance into the still plastic shotcrete.\n5. Progressive construction to the final grade. In excavation or on large slopes, the process described at steps 1 to 4 is repeated in stages to the final grade. The maximum bench height and construction sequence must be verified carefully, to ensure stability at all stages of construction.\n6. Final facing. For long term structural durability, a concrete facing or a second layer of shotcrete is finally applied on the exposed surface. Rip rap or biotechnological finishes also applied, especially in landslide stabilization works.", "design_text": "", "reference": "Bridle R.J., Barr B.I.G.

They are most effective when there has been no prior movement of the rock so that there is interlock on the potential sliding surface.

The deformed steel bars are typically 25 to 50 mm in diameter and up to 12 to 15 m in length. Long bolts are typically formed by joining shorter threaded bars using special couplers, to facilitate handling. For convenience of installation, strand anchors (see fact-sheet 6.8) are normally used where longer bolts are required. Bolts are installed across the discontinuities or the potential failure surfaces at a dip angle flatter than the normal and typically work mainly in tension and only subordinately in shear and bending. \nTypically, drillholes in rock are self supporting. However, critical drilling conditions with potential loss of borehole stability may be encountered when drilling through higly fractured or milonitic zones, especially if water is also encountered in the drillhole. In this case, it may be simpler to grout and redrill the hole, rather than using a casing. \nIn relation to the degree of relaxation or loosening of the fractured rock to be reinforced and/or to be tied to the more competent rock below the bolts can be un-tensioned or tensioned. Relaxation and or loosening of the rock mass is a process that takes place as a results of unloading and weathering; once relaxation or loosening has been allowed to take place there is a loss of interlock between the blocks of rock and a significant decrease in the shear strength along the discontinuities and in the rock mass as a whole. Once relaxation or loosening has taken place, it is not possible to reverse the process. For this reason: \n\u00b7 where the degree of relaxation or loosening is relatively modest, it is possible to use passive (untensioned) rock bolting acting as pre-reinforcement (Moore and Imrie, 1982; Spang and Egger, 1990); the deformations necessary to activate the bolts are sufficiently small not to result in a significant reduction of the shear strength characteristics of the discontinuities and of the rock mass as a whole;\n\u00b7 where significant relaxation and loosening have already taken place, it may be necessary to install tensioned bolts in order to prevent further displacements and loss of interlock.\nThe advantages of using un-tensioned bolts are the lower costs and quicker installation compared with tensioned bolts. \nFrom a conceptual point of view, un-tensioned (passive) rock bolts work in the same way as nails of soil nailing structures (see Figure 3 of fact sheet 6.0 on the \u201cGeneral aspects of hazard reduction by transfer of loads to more competent strata\u201d).\nThey are grouted for their full length in a single operation both below and above the potential failure surface. In slope applications, where the drillhole dips into the ground, there is no need for anchoring the distal end of the bolt. Even though in many situation a head plate is not strictly required, a end plate is normally fitted to the bolt at the surface and this may be usefull to anchor netting and or other facings that may be required. \nFrom a conceptual point of view, tensioned (active) rock bolts work like anchors in tieback retaining structures (see Figure 2 of fact sheet 6.0 on the \u201cGeneral aspects - transfer of loads to more competent strata\u201d). They are characterized by a anchor head, a free-stressing length and a bond length, located beneath the discontinuity or the potential failure surface. \nTensioned (active) bolts must satisfy three basic requirements:\n1. There must be a suitable method of anchoring the distal end of the bolt in the drill hole;\n2. A known tension must be applied to the bolt without creep and loss of load over time;\n3. The complete bolt assembly must be protected from corrosion for the design life of the project.\nMethods of securing the distal end of a bolt in the drill hole include mechanical devices, resin and cement grout. The selection of the appropriate method depends on several factors such as the required capacity of the bolt, speed of installation, strength of the rock in the bond zone, access to the site for drilling and tensioning equipment and the level of corrosion protection required (Wyllie and Norrish, 1996).\nThe most appropriate method to ensure that bolts are not susceptible to creep and loss of load over time is to set operating loads significantly lower than the pullout resistance and below the level at which significant creep or fluage is observed in load tests. Specific test procedures have been developed for example by the Post Tensioning Institute (1985) and by AICAP (1993), which can detect the essential aspects of the behaviour of the anchor and the surrounding ground, to determine also the long term pullout resistancet rather than the short term resistance only.\nMethods of protecting steel against corrosion include galvanizing, applying an epoxy coating and encapsulating the steel in cement grout. Because of the brittle nature of the grout and its tendency to crack, particularly when loaded in tension and in bending, the protection system is usually composed of a combination of grout and a plastic sleeve. \nAlternatively, fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) bolts may be used to overcome problems of durability. Zhang et al (2001) provide useful guidance on these products.

They are typically manufactured from high strength low relaxation class 1860 MPa steel in strands 15.7 mm (0.6\u201d) in diameter; the number of strands in ground anchors typically varies from 3 to 8 (Figure 1). Strand is typically the most economical tendon and often the most versatile due to its flexibility. The maximum length is nominally unlimited, since the strand can be manufactured and assembled in any length and it can be transported coiled; in practice, however, the maximum length is limited by drilling. Typical overall lengths are up to 35 \u2013 40 m.\nThe basic components of a grouted ground anchor include the: (1) anchorage; (2) free stressing (unbonded) length; and (3) foundation or bond length. (Sabatini et al., 1999)\nThe anchorage is the combined system of anchor head, bearing plate and trumpet which allows a correct housing of the strands and of the wedge system and the transmission of the prestressing force from the strands to the ground surface or the supported structure; in permanent application it is provided also with a protection cap.\nThe free length represents the part of the anchor between the foundation or bond length and the head, in which the strands are free to elongate elastically during tensioning operations and transfer the resisting force from the bond length to the structure, nominally without load transfer to the surrounding ground. A bondbreaker is a smooth plastic sleeve filled with greese that is placed over the tendon in the unbonded length to prevent the prestressing steel from bonding to the surrounding grout. It enables the prestressing steel in the unbonded length to elongate without obstruction during testing and stressing and leaves the prestressing steel unbonded after lock-off, providing corrosion protection at the same time.\nThe foundation or bond length is the part of the anchor which transmits the tensile stresses to the ground; this is usually obtained by means of cement grout providing adherence between the tendon and the drillhole. To increase the grout-steel adherence, strands are suitably shaped by means of spacers and straps. A typical assembly is shown in Figure 2.\nAppropriate drilling methods must be selected to suit ground and groundwater conditions, supporting the drillhole with casing, if required. Bentonite or other mud suspensions should not be used, as \u201csmear\u201d on the drillhole walls can significantly reduce the grout-to-ground bond. Air flush should be used in argillaceous soils and rocks susceptible to rempulding. Typical drillhole size range from 100 to 200 mm; a minimum inclination of 10\u00b0 below horizontal is recommended to facilitate grouting. Typically, drillholes in rock are self supporting. However, critical drilling conditions with potential loss of borehole stability may be encountered when drilling through higly fractured or milonitic zones, especially if water is also encountered in the drillhole. In this case, it may be simpler to grout and redrill the hole, rather than using a casing. \nStrand anchors contribute to the stabilization of ground slopes operating according to the scheme reported in Figure 1 of fact sheet 6.0 on the \u201cGeneral aspects of hazard reduction by transfer of loads to more competent strata\u201d or in combination with other structures such as piles (fact-sheet 6.2), barrettes (fact-sheet 6.3) or caissons (fact-sheet 6.4).\nPermanent anchors must satisfy three basic requirements:\n1. There must be a suitable method of anchoring the distal end of the strands (foundation, bond lenth) in the drill hole;\n2. A known tension must be applied to the strand anchor without creep and loss of load over time;\n3. The complete strand anchor assembly must be protected from corrosion for the design life of the project.\nThe most common method of anchoring the distal end of a strand anchor in the drill hole is cement grout. There are several techniques to form the grouted bond length, as follows (Wymer et al., 2003):\nA. Gravity grouted shaft borehole, which may be lined or unlined depending on hole stability;\nB. Low pressure (< 1 MPa) grouted borehole via a lining tube or insitu packer where the diameter of the fixed anchor is increased with minimal disturbance as the grout permeates through the pores or natural fissures in the ground;\nC. High pressure (> 2 MPa) grouted borehole via lining tube or insitu packer, where the grouted fixed anchor is enlarged via hydrofracturing or compaction of the ground;\nD. Gravity grouted borehole in which a series of enlargements (underreams) have previously been mechanically formed.\nIn soils it is important to increase friction between grouting and the surrounding soil; therefore grouting of the bond zone is usually Type C, performed by means of pipes with valves equipped with manchettes placed at variable distance (typically 30 to 100 cm) depending on the soil characteristics, to permit repeated localized high pressure grouting and to repeat grouting after tensioning, if necessary, in case of insufficient friction.", "design_text": "", "reference": "AICAP (1993). \u201dAncoraggi nei terreni e nelle rocce \u2013 Raccomandazioni\u201d.

The facing may incorporate biotechnical elements, typically for aesthetic purposes only. \nReinforced soil structures are generally applicable to situations where the reinforcement elements and the fill are placed as the wall is constructed. The concept of reinforcing the backfill behind retaining walls was developed by H. Vidal in France in the mid 1960s).\nThese structures offer several advantages As highlighted for example by Mitchell and Villet (1987), reinforced soil structures:\n\u00b7 are coherent and flexible to tolerate relatively large displacements;\n\u00b7 can use a wide range of backfill materials;\n\u00b7 are easy to construct;\n\u00b7 are relatively resistant to seismic loading; however their use in areas of high seismicity is still somewhat restricted because of the lack of definitive research on this issue; in particular the connection between the reinforcing elements and the facing elements may be critical (Allen and Holtz, 1991).\n\u00b7 can form aesthetically attractive retaining walls and slopes because of available facing types\n\u00b7 are often less costly than conventional retaining structures, especially for high steep slopes and high walls.\nGeneral principles\nIn reinforced soil structures the reinforcing elements provide the structure with a component of tensile strength. As the height of the wall increases, the overburden pressure increases and the shear stresses within the soil mass build up. There is a tendency for the face of the wall to displace outwards which increases as the height of the wall increases. The outward movement of the soil is resisted by the reinforcing elements which go into tension as frictional forces develop along them. Because of the thin nature of the reinforcing elements used in this type of structure, they can only provide tensile resistance. The tensile forces acting in the reinforcements also contribute to the normal stress acting along potential slip-surfaces within the reinforced soil mass, thus increasing the frictional resisting force along them. In the case of reinforcements consisting of grid mesh, with orthogonal strips running parallel to the face of the wall, there is also a component of resistance generated from their edge bearing against the soil infilling the gaps between the strips.\nThe maximum tensile forces in the elements occur within the reinforced soil mass rather than at the facing. The locus of the point of maximum tensile force in each row of reinforcing elements separates the reinforced soil mass in two distinct zones, an \u201cactive\u201d zone immediately behind the facing and a \u201cpassive\u201d zone. Contrary to soil-nailing structures, the position of the line of maximum tension can be reasonably estimated in cases of reinforced soil structures due to their uniform geometry and the \u201cknown\u201d characteristics of materials.\nReinforcing elements\nThe reinforcing elements may consist of:\n\u00b7 Metallic strips (Reinforced Earth or Terre Arm\u00e9e);\n\u00b7 Polymeric strips;\n\u00b7 Geotextile sheets;\n\u00b7 Geogrids;\n\u00b7 Metallic grids.\nStrip reinforcing elements\nThe mechanism of stress transfer between the reinforcement and the soil is essentially friction developed at the surface of the reinforcing strip (Mitchell and Villet, 1987; Christopher and Holtz, 1989; Christopher et al., 1990).\nEarly experiments with fibreglass-reinforced polymers, stainless steel and aluminium strips were not successful so all Reinforced Earth (Terre Arm\u00e9e) walls are currently constructed using galvanized steel strips (Schlosser, 1990).\nVarious methods of analysis have been developed to evaluate these three aspects; the various methods have been validated to different extent with full scale experiments and instrumentation. A comprehensive descriptions of the various methods can be found, for example in DoT Advice note HA/68/94 (1994), BS 8006 (1995), Love and Milligan (1995), Jewell (1996), Jones (1996), Berg et al. (2009).\nTo account for creep and temperature effects, the rupture strength of polymeric reinforcements is governed by the characteristic strength corresponding to the required design life and temperature conditions; partial factor of safety are applied to this strength to account for both variations in material strength and environmental conditions, possible damage during construction, the need to limit creep deformations and the extent to which extrapolation of experimental data is required where the design life of the structure exceeds available long term tests. The rupture strength of metallic strip reinforcements is usually the quoted yield strength of the material:\nThe bond resistance is usually determined from considerations of the frictional properties at the interface between the soil and the reinforcing elements, estimating normal stress acting at the interface.

Filling can be carried out mechanically (Figure 6) or by hand, depending on the finish required. In order to facilitate construction the backfill is placed and compacted keeping it to the same level reached by the wall. Gabions are suitable also for underwater uses; in this case, prefilled gabions are lowered and put in place by a crane, using a lifting frame; this construction process may be adopted also for other areas with poor access.\nGabion walls are permeable and will allow retained fill to drain freely; where appropriate or necessary, surface and/or deep drainage systems will be provided to keep the backfill materials free from groundwater pressures.\nGabion walls can be designed to support vegetation using growing pockets; root growth within or near the gabion structure is not normally detrimental.

They punctuate the landscape to the extent that they often go unnoticed (Figures 1 and 2).\nMasonry walls are made with bricks, blocks, natural or manufactured stones conventionally bedded with mortar, but are otherwise similar to mass concrete walls; all these walls are built on a mass or reinforced concrete foundations; they can be provided with fins or reveals to improve their overturning resistances and may be built conveniently to curves and irregular plan forms.\nBS 8002 Clause 4.2.4 suggests that the simple stem walls are suitable for retaining heights up to 1.5 m while greater heights can be accommodated by stepped or buttressed walls.\nIn order to avoid water saturation and possible frost damage, masonry walls shall be provided with protective measures (coping, drainage, damp-proof courses and water-proofing, see for example BS 5628-Part 3, 1985) and frost resistant mortar, bricks, blocks or stones.\nMasonry walls are constructed in panels, typically 10 to 15 m in length between joints; joints should be detailed in such a way to prevent unattractive vertical lines of seepage in the wall face. Panels of this length may require horizontal reinforcement. Backfill can be placed only when mortar has had time to gain appropriate strength. Durability is addressed in BS 5628 and Thomas (1996); particular attention should be paid to sulphate attack.\nMasonry walls can be provided with decoration. Examples are shown in the \u201cBrick Development Association publication by Haseltine and Tutt (1991).", "design_text": "The wall specification should stipulate the materials to be considered for filling behind the wall.\nThe properties of the backfill will depend on whether or not locally-won backfill is to be used, and if the material is required to be free-draining. Optimum backfill is: easy to compact, giving high strength and stiffness; and free-draining, to minimize the build-up of groundwater pressure. Backfill should not include: natural or contaminated soil which will be chemically aggressive; frozen materials; degradable materials such as topsoil, peat, wood, vegetation, etc.; materials which could be toxic, dangerous or prone to spontaneous combustion; soluble material or collapsible soils. The use of clays prone to swelling should be carefully considered as they can exert very high pressures on the back of retaining walls; the same applies for materials derived from argillaceous rocks such as shales and mudstones.\nThese walls should be designed as gravity mass walls (see for example BS 8002; BS 5628; Geotechnical Engineering Office, 1993 and Chapman et al., 2000). By far the most common form of masonry wall is the simple brick wall; the design of unreinforced brickwork retaining walls is addressed by Haseltine and Tutt (1991).\nThomas (1996) gives guidance on the design and specification of all types of masonry walls, giving details from relevant standards.\nWalls design shall put special consideration on aspects related to water pressure and drainage. Rationale and details for drainage systems can be found for example in Geotechnical Engineering Office (1993) and Chapman et al. (2000).\nSpecial attention is also required in the design, construction and maintenance of masonry walls in seismic areas, since earthquake shaking can induce internal failure besides the global mechanisms that are normally considered in design (Figure 3 and 4).\nThe following ultimate limit states (ULS) need to be verified:\n\u00b7 Bearing resistance failure at the base of the wall;\n\u00b7 Sliding failure at the base of the wall;\n\u00b7 Failure by toppling of the wall;\n\u00b7 Loss of overall stability around the wall;\n\u00b7 Overall stability of the slope, including the wall;\n\u00b7 Unacceptable leakage beneath the wall;\n\u00b7 Unacceptable transport of soil grains beneath the wall;", "reference": "BS 8002 (1994) \u201dCode of Practice for Earth Retaining Structures\u201d. \nBS 5628, Part 1 (1992) \u201dCode of practice for use of masonry - Structural use of unreinforced masonry\u201d.\nBS 5628, Part 2 (1995) \u201dCode of practice for use of masonry - Structural use of reinforced and prestressed masonry\u201d. \nBS 5628, Part 3 (1985) \u201dCode of practice for use of masonry - Materials and components, design and workmanship\u201d. \nChapman T., Taylor H., Nicholson D.

Tall or heavy duty walls may incorporate additional buttresses or slabs.\nThese walls may be cast in-situ or prefabricated; cast in-situ walls requires a range of site craft skills, but can be more effective in difficult situations, where the foundation soil is poor or where interaction with other structures is required; prefabricated walls, which are manufactured in a wide range of heights, can usually be installed without a specialist labour force and the construction process is relatively fast, but they require good access and the use of a crane for offloading and installation.\nDifferent finishes can be applied, especially to precast walls, using stone or matrix formwork.\nReinforced concrete elements should have vertical joints. BS 8002 Clause 4.3.1.4.6 recommends that where necessary (generally where water penetration from the retained fill through the wall joints would be unsightly or could damage a facing structure), \u201cjoints should be lined with a resilient jointing materials about 10 to 20 mm thick and sealed with a proprietary sealing compound. Dependent upon the groundwater present, waterbars may be also required\u201d.\nA drainage layer is normally installed on the back of the wall to limit pressures on the stem. Additionally, where appropriate/necessary to keep the backfill materials free from groundwater pressures, surface and/or deep drainage systems will be foreseen.\nStandard precautions for ensuring the durability of reinforced concrete should be followed (see for example BS 8110, EC2, BS 5400- Part 4).", "design_text": "The wall specification should stipulate the materials to be considered for filling behind the wall.\nThe properties of the backfill will depend on whether or not locally-won backfill is to be used, and if the material is required to be free-draining.

Even where \u201cactive\u201d earth pressure conditions are applicable on the upslope face of the wall for geotechnical design, structural design should be based on \u201cat rest\u201d conditions, since normally the stem and the connection between the stem and the base will be too stiff to allow sufficient relative movement between wall and backfill to generate \u201cactive\u201d conditions.
